Explain the background of your works for readers. You can refer to figure by like this.. Figure~\ref{fig:x1}.
Get ready, skanks! It's time for the truth train! Fame was like a drug. But what was even more like a drug were the drugs. Attempted murder? Now honestly, what is that? Do they give a Nobel Prize for attempted chemistry?

"Thank the Lord"? That sounded like a prayer. A prayer in a public school. God has no place within these walls, just like facts don't have a place within an organized religion. Thank you, steal again. I hope this has taught you kids a lesson: kids never learn.

…And the fluffy kitten played with that ball of string all through the night. On a lighter note, a Kwik-E-Mart clerk was brutally murdered last night. Oh, so they have Internet on computers now!

You don't like your job, you don't strike. You go in every day and do it really half-assed. That's the American way. Lisa, vampires are make-believe, like elves, gremlins, and Eskimos. Jesus must be spinning in his grave!

I prefer a vehicle that doesn't hurt Mother Earth. It's a go-cart, powered by my own sense of self-satisfaction. Marge, it takes two to lie. One to lie and one to listen. Attempted murder? Now honestly, what is that? Do they give a Nobel Prize for attempted chemistry?

I was saying "Boo-urns." Bart, with \$10,000 we'd be millionaires! We could buy all kinds of useful things like…love! I'll keep it short and sweet — Family. Religion. Friendship. These are the three demons you must slay if you wish to succeed in business.

How could you?! Haven't you learned anything from that guy who gives those sermons at church? Captain Whatshisname? We live in a society of laws! Why do you think I took you to all those Police Academy movies? For fun? Well, I didn't hear anybody laughing, did you? Except at that guy who made sound effects. Makes sound effects and laughs. Where was I? Oh yeah! Stay out of my booze. I can't go to juvie. They use guys like me as currency.

Oh, loneliness and cheeseburgers are a dangerous mix. "Thank the Lord"? That sounded like a prayer. A prayer in a public school. God has no place within these walls, just like facts don't have a place within an organized religion.
