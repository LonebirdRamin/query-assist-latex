\section{Introduction}
\section{Problems and Solutions}
State your problems and how you fixed them.
\subsection{Project Initiation Phase} At the outset, there was uncertainty regarding the appropriate steps to initiate the project, leading to hesitation and lack of direction. 

\underline{\textbf{Solution:}} Project plans were discussed with the assigned mentor, and a comprehensive diagram was developed to ensure alignment and clarity among all stakeholders.

\subsection{Communication Enhancement Phase} Communication barriers were identified, resulting in misunderstandings and reduced team efficiency. 

\underline{\textbf{Solution:}} Active efforts were made to improve communication channels, fostering better understanding and minimizing the risk of miscommunication.

\subsection{Knowledge Acquisition Phase} Gaps in knowledge within specific technical areas hindered progress and limited the ability to make informed decisions. 

\underline{\textbf{Solution:}} Targeted research and practical test runs were conducted to deepen understanding of the system and address knowledge deficiencies.

\subsection{Terminology Familiarization Phase} Unfamiliarity with domain-specific terminology, particularly terms used by Agoda, created confusion and slowed progress. 

\underline{\textbf{Solution:}} Continuous learning and proactive inquiry were employed to clarify unfamiliar terms, resulting in increased familiarity with the relevant processes.

\subsection{Time Management} Excessive time was being allocated to certain tasks, negatively impacting overall project timelines. 

\underline{\textbf{Solution:}} Timetables and time management strategies were refined to enhance productivity and ensure more efficient allocation of resources.
